# Setup

To start programming with JavaScript, we need to install [_NodeJS_](https://nodejs.org/en) and a _Code Editor_.

- NodeJS is a JavaScript _runtime environment_, in other words, it allows the computer to "understand" JavaScript.
- Code Editor is a text editor that is specifically designed for coding. For example, Microsoft Word is a text editor, but it's not designed for coding. Notepad is a generic text editor that isn't designed for either coding or document editing; it's for taking on-the-fly notes.

For code editing, feel free to use whatever you prefer. We're going to use [_Visual Studio Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not Visual Studio).
